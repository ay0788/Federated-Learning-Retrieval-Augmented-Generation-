# 🤖 Federated Learning & Retrieval-Augmented Generation 🚀

Welcome to the **Federated Learning (FL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Notebook!**  
This repository provides an in-depth look at how to build AI models that preserve privacy while leveraging decentralized data and advanced retrieval techniques.

## 📚 Overview
Train AI models securely across devices without sharing sensitive data! This project combines FL and RAG to achieve:
- **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: Train models across decentralized devices without exposing raw data.
- **Enhanced AI Performance**: Use RAG to fine-tune AI with powerful retrieval methods for smarter outputs.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ay0788/Federated-Learning-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-.git
cd Federated-Learning-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📖 Usage

1. Prepare your data (see `/data` folder or the sample data script).
2. Explore the example notebooks in `/notebooks`.
3. Use source code in `/src` to build, train, and evaluate models.
4. Run tests with `pytest`.

## 📝 Example

See [`notebooks/example_fl_rag.ipynb`](notebooks/example_fl_rag.ipynb) for a full workflow demo!
