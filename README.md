# 🤖 Federated Learning & Retrieval-Augmented Generation 🚀  

Welcome to the **Federated Learning (FL) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Notebook!**  
This repository provides an in-depth look at how to build AI models that preserve privacy while leveraging decentralized data and advanced retrieval techniques.  

## 📚 Overview  
Want to train AI models securely across devices without sharing sensitive data? This project combines FL and RAG to achieve:  
- **Privacy-Preserving Learning**: Train models across decentralized devices without exposing raw data.  
- **Enhanced AI Performance**: Use RAG to fine-tune AI with powerful retrieval methods for smarter outputs.  

### Key Highlights:  
- 🌐 **Choosing the Right Architecture**: Step-by-step code for setting up FL and RAG.  
- 📊 **Managing Data Across Devices**: Decentralized data handling made simple.  
- 🛠️ **Fine-Tuning Retrieval Models**: Maximize AI performance with RAG optimization.  
- 🔒 **Ensuring Secure Communication**: Implement privacy mechanisms for FL.
